_Irene Polnyi_

Iâ€™ve been collecting and refining skills to help businesses succeed, reconnect them to what matters, and manage internal change.

I want to take the skills built through work for blue chip clients and apply them to a budding company that ignites my passion and fuels my ambition for building a better world.

Are you a fast-moving, ai-first company? enabling smart cities? building life-changing, high-tech hardware? making lives healthier, happier or more equal? [Email me.](irenepolnyi@gmail.com)
