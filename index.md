I've been collecting and refining skills to help businesses succeed, reconnect them to what matters, and manage internal change.

I want to take the skills built through work for blue chip clients and apply them to a budding company that ignites my passion and fuels my ambition for building a better world.

I'm currently contracting with companies to help them understand new market opportunities, define their product offer, make it relevant to customers and become business-viable. If this is you, [email me](irenepolnyi@gmail.com) for my resume and availability.

I occasionally write about how companies are [Selling the Future](https://medium.com/@ireneface/introducing-selling-the-future-4d7da8f655fa) on Medium.
