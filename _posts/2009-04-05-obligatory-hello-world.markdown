I've spent a good part of today on the seventh iteration of tatey.com.

1. Design
2. XHTML/CSS
3. Jekyllfy
4. About content
5. Generate and publish

It's generated by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master), a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby. Posts are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the source resides on [GitHub](http://github.com/tatey/tatey.com/tree/master), never to be lost again! Site conforms to the XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1 specifications. All pages are valid and semantic. I've only tested in Firefox 3.0.8 and Safari 4b on Mac OS X. If you find an error, [please let me know](mailto:tate@tatey.com).

Next step is to automate deployment.
